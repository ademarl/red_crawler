DEVELOPER NOTES

This was my first project with Go. Because of this unfamiliarity, a lot of good coding techniques concerning clarity, conciseness, reuse, etc., have suffered.
I wish I could have made the project better in many ways. Particularly, the specification did not suggest anything other than a simple Web Crawler in working
condition. And though I am aware of many improvements to the tool, there was no time for me to tackle them. The only improvement I was able to implement was
parallelism.


Thank you for the opportunity, I surely have learned a few things from this project!
Hoping to hear from you soon :)
