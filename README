	RED CRAWLER

Author: Ademar Marques Lacerda Filho

This program implements a very simple parallel web crawler that takes information of market shares traded by Bovespa
It was developed for Linux environments using go1.11 (more specifications at the bottom)
The development was commissioned as a challenge by the marketing company Red Ventures


COMPILE & RUN
To run the application, first configure the mysql_settings file with a valid login followed by the password.
Then, simply use the run.sh script (which also compiles) by the command line './run.sh' from the project directory that contains this file.
It might be necessary to give execution permissions to this file by using the command 'chmod +x run.sh'

At the end of the execution


KNOWN ISSUES

-The HTTP requests might be blocked or timed out by the website because of its volume.
A macro called WAIT in the main source file 'src/red_crawler.go' controls how long the application waits in between parallel requests. It may be better tuned.
Beware that here there is a tradeoff of performance vs reliability.

-The final list of 10 shares is, mostly, inconsistent.
Testing it, I have observed some webpages are continually broken and other requests often fail randomly.
These observations seem to be independent of timed out connections because of frequent requests described above.

-Special Unicode characters in terminal and MySQL were not handled asthetically
The MySQL environment is automatically configured (by the program) to accept them
Change configurations back manually if needed for other purposes.
