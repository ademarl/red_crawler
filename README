This program implements a very simple parallel web crawler that takes information of market shares traded by Bovespa
It was developed for Linux environments using go1.11 (more specifications at the bottom)
The development was commissioned as a challenge by the marketing company Red Ventures


COMPILE & RUN
To run the application, first configure the mysql_settings file with a valid login followed by the password.
Then, simply use the run.sh script (which also compiles) by the command line './run.sh' from the project directory that contains this file.
It might be necessary to give this file execution permissions by using the command 'chmod +x run.sh'

At the end of the execution


KNOWN ISSUES

-The HTTP requests might be blocked or timed out by the website because of its volume.
A macro called WAIT in the main source file 'src/red_crawler.go' controls how long the application waits in between parallel requests. It may be better tuned.
Beware that here there is a tradeoff of performance vs reliability.

-Special Unicode characters in terminal and MySQL were not handled asthetically


PORTABILITY

This is the environment which was used for evelopment and refers to GOLANG.
